## 🛠️ Projects Currently Online

### 1. Classical Search Algorithms Explorer

**Description:**
An interactive web application designed to help users explore and understand the concepts of classical search algorithms: **Breadth-First Search (BFS)**, **Depth-First Search (DFS)**, and **A\* Search Algorithm**. The app provides visualizations and step-by-step explanations to illustrate how each algorithm operates in different scenarios.

**Live Demo:**

### 2. Adversarial Search Game Simulator

**Description:**
An interactive web application that showcases adversarial search in action. In this grid-based game, two robots compete:

- **Good Robot (🤖):** Uses the MINIMAX algorithm (with adjustable depth) to navigate toward a goal (❤️) while avoiding danger.
- **Bad Robot (👾):** Tries to intercept and zap the good robot using strategies ranging from random moves to MINIMAX with varying depths and different evaluation functions.

Explore how different decision-making strategies play out in a competitive environment as each robot’s path is visually tracked on the grid.

**Live Demo:**

### 3. Perceptron Visualizer

**Description:**
A dynamic, single-layer perceptron explorer that demonstrates how a single neuron can learn to differentiate between two classes. By adjusting the **weights** and **bias** interactively, you can see how the decision boundary changes in real-time. This tool also includes demos for basic boolean logic gates (AND, OR, NAND, NOR, XOR) and additional custom operations. It is a resource for visual learners who wish to understand perceptron fundamentals and the geometry behind linear separability.
